# PraiseGDD
Project Summary: GDD Dashboard for Arborists
Goal: Build an interactive web-based dashboard that provides localized Growing Degree Day (GDD) information with phenological context for pests and plants to help arborists make timely, data-driven decisions.
Key Components:

GDD Data Integration: Pull and aggregate GDD data from MSU's GDD Tracker by zip code
Interactive Dashboard: Main "Simon" page with branch-wide averages and territory-specific tabs
Phenological Context: Display upcoming events and current pest statuses
Dual View System: Branch-wide averages and individual territory breakdowns by zip code

Core Features:

View GDD data at branch, territory, and zip code levels
See predictions (e.g., "Bagworm larvae expected to hatch in ~10 days")
Monitor real-time status updates (e.g., "Bagworms – Status: ACTIVE, VULNERABLE")
Interactive navigation between different territories and zip codes

I'll restructure the PraiseGDD roadmap to be more actionable and similar to your Diane project format, with numbered steps and a clear directory structure.
